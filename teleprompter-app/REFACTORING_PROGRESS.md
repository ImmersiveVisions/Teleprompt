# Teleprompter App Refactoring Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Improvements 
‚úÖ **Implemented Context-based State Management**
- Created ScriptContext for script management
- Created ConnectionContext for WebSocket connections 
- Created TeleprompterContext for teleprompter controls
- Implemented proper context providers in App.jsx
- Added Error Boundary for global error handling

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring (In Progress)
‚úÖ **Improved Component Separation**
- Refactored AdminPage.jsx to use context providers
- Extracted DeleteScriptModal as a separate component
- Used existing UI components for better organization:
  - ScriptList
  - TeleprompterControlPanel 
  - ConnectionPanel
  - ScriptSearchPanel

‚úÖ **Enhanced Hooks Organization**
- Created a position hooks folder structure
- Extracted useRollbackHandler to a separate hook
- Created index files for easier importing
- Improved code reusability

‚úÖ **Search Functionality Enhancements**
- Fixed search function in AdminPage.jsx to use the useSearchHandler hook properly
- Removed duplicate function declarations in AdminPage.jsx
- Enhanced iframe detection to reliably find the content iframe
- Improved error handling and debugging for search operations
- Fixed search result clicking functionality

‚úÖ **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed an issue with connected clients tracking
- Increased font size for better readability
- Improved ViewerPage component to use contexts
- Fixed search result click handling

### Phase 3: Build and Testing
‚úÖ **Build Fixes**
- Fixed import path issues in position hooks after moving to subfolder
- Modified fileSystemRepository.js to handle non-browser environments
- Added mocks for localStorage and other browser APIs in tests
- Fixed WebSocket event subscription to use registerMessageHandler
- Successfully ran build process with no errors
- Most unit tests passing (30 out of 34)
- Fixed build errors related to duplicate function declarations

## Ongoing Tasks

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring (Continuing)
üîÑ **Further Component Extraction**
- Continue extracting functionality from AdminPage.jsx
- Move remaining DOM manipulation to proper hooks
- Refactor shared components for better reusability

üîÑ **Improved State Management**
- Continue replacing local state with context state
- Reduce direct DOM manipulation
- Improve code organization
- Add error state handling to search and navigation functions

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation
üîÑ **Testing Improvements**
- Fix useScriptManager tests to work with JSDOM environment
- Add tests for new components and hooks
- Improve test coverage

üîÑ **Documentation Updates**
- Update documentation to reflect new architecture
- Document context API usage
- Create component documentation

## Future Tasks

### Phase 4: Optimization and Enhancement
‚è≥ **Performance Optimization**
- Add React.memo for optimized rendering
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Profile and optimize critical rendering paths

‚è≥ **Additional Features**
- Improve error handling throughout the application
- Add more user feedback for operations
- Enhance accessibility features

## Results So Far

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Reduced component size and complexity
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Improved code reusability with custom hooks
   - Enhanced maintainability
   - Eliminated duplicate function implementations

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Fixed search functionality for better content navigation
   - Improved font size for readability
   - More accurate client connection tracking
   - Enhanced error handling with meaningful error messages
   - More reliable script searching and navigation

3. **Developer Experience Improvements**
   - Better code organization with proper hook architecture
   - Clearer component responsibilities
   - More intuitive hook structure
   - Improved debugging through enhanced logging
   - More reliable build process with fewer errors

## Build Fixes Summary

During the refactoring, we encountered and fixed the following build issues:

1. **Import Path Issue**: After moving hooks to a subfolder, we had to adjust import paths to correctly point to the websocket service.

2. **Browser API Compatibility**: Modified fileSystemRepository.js to safely handle localStorage in both browser and test environments with a wrapper function.

3. **Test Environment Setup**: Fixed setupTests.js to properly mock browser APIs and fixed environment configuration in the tests.

4. **Test Dependencies**: Added @testing-library/react-hooks for testing React hooks.

5. **Duplicate Function Declarations**: Fixed multiple instances of duplicate function declarations in AdminPage.jsx that were causing compilation errors:
   - Removed duplicate `executeSearch` declaration
   - Removed duplicate `jumpToSearchResult` declaration
   - Properly integrated the useSearchHandler hook

6. **Search Functionality**: Fixed search functionality that was broken due to iframe selection issues:
   - Improved iframe detection to reliably find content regardless of iframe ID
   - Added proper error handling for scriptPlayerRef
   - Fixed search result click handling to properly pass references
